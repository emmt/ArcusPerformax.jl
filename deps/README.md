# Automatic build of Julia bindings to a library

Edit files [`generator.toml`](./generator.toml) and
[`build.jl`](./build.jl).  In `build.jl`, it should be sufficient to
change the value of `headers` (and the name of the TOML file if you change it).

Execute the generator:

```sh
julia build.jl
```
